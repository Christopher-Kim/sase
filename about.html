								<h3>How we will help the next generation of scientists and engineers...</h3>
								<p>Our theme this year focuses on emphasizing the success of the professionals that have reached back to foster new growth and lead the younger generation to thrive along their side. We would like to highlight the following aspects that lead us to this theme:</p>

								<ul>
										<li>We want to remind our members to always strive towards their dreams and realize that they are never alone</li>
										<li>We want to aid them in successfully finding their passions and learn how to grow towards it efficiently</li>
										<li>We want to provide an environment where leadership can thrive within every member of SASE like a forest of light, we can only grow brighter and stronger with time so letâ€™s all cultivate our dreams and grow together!</li>
									</ul>

								<h4>An opportunity that comes only once a year</h4>
								<p>Attending our South Central Regional Conference provides an excellent opportunity for those involved in SASE to meet new people, and reunite with friends. The conference is also a chance to network with industry professionals, various company representatives, as well as our fellow aspiring scientists and engineers. SCRC 2020 promises you with professional workshops, keynote speakers, a networking session, and social activities in order to provide unique learning and career building opportunities that you just can not find anywhere else.</p>

								<p>Remember to mark your calendar for March 21st, 2020 for the South Central Regional Conference at UTA!</p>
